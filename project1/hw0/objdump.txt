3) main section + address
Commands used:

4) Stack and heap visible?
Answer:
I do not see a “stack section” or “heap section” in objdump because stack/heap are not stored in the executable file.
They are created/managed at runtime by the OS (stack) and dynamic memory allocation mechanisms like malloc/brk/mmap (heap).
